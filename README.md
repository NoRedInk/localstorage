# LocalStorage

Local storage for Elm.

This library offers access to the browser's localstorage, which is
limited to string keys and values. It uses Elm Tasks for storage IO.

It also provides a Subscription to localstorage events.

This work is derived directly from the LocalStorage.elm module in elm-flatris.
